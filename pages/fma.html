        <p>Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood follows brothers Edward and Alphonse Elric, who use alchemy to try and resurrect their dead mother but suffer disastrous consequences—Edward loses an arm and a leg, while Alphonse loses his entire body. To restore
            themselves, they seek the Philosopher’s Stone, uncovering dark secrets about their world, corrupt government, and powerful enemies known as Homunculi. Along the way, they learn about sacrifice, truth, and what it truly means to be human.</p>
